Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Scandy stuff - 3D scanning on mobile devices. Also learning to code when I have time. Which isn't a lot.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python + javascript. Also trying to write better tickets when I do the PM thing.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on 3D scanning on mobile devices. Because that is what Scandy does.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with marketing. That sh\t is *hard*.
