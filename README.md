### Hi there. I'm the old man. Wouldn't have it any other way. You can stay on my lawn if you're nice.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Scandy stuff - 3D scanning on mobile devices. Also learning to code when I have time. Which isn't a lot.
- ðŸŒ± Currently working hard on my python. Also trying to write better tickets when I do the PM thing.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: charles@scandy.co or say hey @carriere4 on Twitter
- âš¡ Fun fact: espresso is my superpower
