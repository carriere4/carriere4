### Hi there. I'm the old man. Wouldn't have it any other way. You can stay on my lawn if you're nice.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Scandy stuff - 3D scanning on mobile devices. Also learning to code when I have time. Which isn't a lot.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python + javascript. Also trying to write better tickets when I do the PM thing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on 3D scanning on mobile devices. Because that is what Scandy does.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with marketing. That sh\t is *hard*. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: charles@scandy.co or say hey @carriere4 on Twitter
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Beer and whiskey make me more fun and less factual.
